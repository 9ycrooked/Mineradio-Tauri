# Baseline Capture

更新时间：2026-06-30

## Purpose

This document defines the Electron baseline capture required before final Tauri parity review. Tauri visual, interaction, provider, runtime, and release parity is judged against these captures plus the code-derived animation spec.

Code-derived animation spec: `docs/migration/baseline/BASELINE_ANIMATION_SPEC.md`.

## Evidence Rule

- Do not mark a capture as complete unless an artifact path is recorded in `BASELINE_METADATA.*.json` or a release-evidence document.
- Code-side implementation notes are not capture evidence.
- Credential-gated Netease/QQ checks require B1 credentials and must record the login state used during capture.
- Release/update checks must record the updater decision used for that run, especially if install is blocked by signature policy.

## 2026-06-30 Reconciliation Note

Previously recorded static references are orientation only. They help future agents compare framing and layout, but remaining `pending` or `blocked` capture rows still block public release parity until manually captured. Do not mark captures complete without artifact paths in metadata or a release-evidence document; large screenshots and recordings stay outside git, with only small docs/metadata committed.

## Capture Matrix

每个 capture 需要在 metadata 中记录：`kind`、窗口尺寸或运行环境、路径、采集方法、provider/login 状态（如相关）、观察结论和是否 nonblank。状态只允许写 `recorded`、`pending` 或 `blocked`。

## Previously Recorded Static References

- Home idle, 1920x1080: `verification\baseline\2026-06-27-ced5ec61\home-idle-window.png`
- Home idle, 1280x720: `verification\baseline\2026-06-27-ced5ec61\home-idle-1280x720.png`
- Login modal/main UI references: `verification\baseline\2026-06-27-ced5ec61\main-ui-1280x720.png` and `verification\baseline\2026-06-27-ced5ec61\main-ui-no-modal-1280x720.png`
- Search results fixture: `verification\baseline\2026-06-27-ced5ec61\search-results-yujian-1280x720.png`
- Playback console static visible/hidden: `verification\baseline\2026-06-27-ced5ec61\playback-console-visible-1280x720.png` and `verification\baseline\2026-06-27-ced5ec61\playback-console-hidden-1280x720.png`
- Visual console static reference: `verification\baseline\2026-06-27-ced5ec61\visual-console-panel-1280x720.png`
- 3D shelf static reference: `verification\baseline\2026-06-27-ced5ec61\playlist-shelf-side-1280x720.png`
- Desktop lyrics open static reference: `verification\baseline\2026-06-27-ced5ec61\desktop-lyrics-open.png`

These static references do not close the final WebView2 parity gates by themselves. They are retained as baseline orientation and must be supplemented by the required manual captures above.

## Storage Rules

- Store large screenshots and recordings outside git unless explicitly curated.
- Suggested ignored local folder: `verification\baseline\2026-06-27-ced5ec61`.
- Suggested external backup folder: `D:\项目\工作区备份\Mineradio-tauri-baseline-20260627`.
- Commit only this document and small metadata JSON.
- When evidence is stored outside git, record both the local path and backup path in metadata.

## P1 Acceptance

Tauri migration work may proceed past P1 when commit, branch, window sizes, display scale, artifact directory, visual archive source, and code-derived animation spec are recorded.

Current status on 2026-06-27: commit, branch, window sizes, display scale, artifact directory, search fixture, visual archive source, and code-derived animation spec are recorded. Fixed playback test track, cover source, and lyric source remain open. Screenshot/recording gaps are moved to pre-public-release manual parity instead of blocking P1.

## Public Release Parity Acceptance

Before public release, the Tauri line still needs fixed playback test track metadata, cover source, lyric source, Windows/WebView2 startup shell evidence, proxied playback evidence, provider credential-gated evidence, visual-host nonblank evidence, 3D shelf flow evidence, desktop lyrics lock/unlock/drag evidence, sidecar lifecycle evidence, login cookie injection evidence, and installer/update/uninstall evidence.

The release gate remains open until every required row above is either recorded with artifact paths or explicitly blocked by a named decision in `docs/migration/CAPABILITY_PARITY_CHECKLIST.md`, `docs/migration/DEFERRED_CAPABILITIES.md`, or `docs/migration/LICENSE_GATE.md`.
