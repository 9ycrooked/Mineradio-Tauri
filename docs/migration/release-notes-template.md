# Mineradio Tauri Rewrite Release Notes

## Identity

Mineradio Tauri Rewrite is a GPL-3.0 fork/rewrite published from `zzstar101/Mineradio`.

This release is not an official Netease Cloud Music, QQ Music, or original Mineradio release. Netease Cloud Music and QQ Music remain third-party service providers accessed through user-provided credentials and provider APIs.

## Update Channel

This Tauri line uses the new GitHub Releases channel under `zzstar101/Mineradio`.

It does not migrate or reuse the old Electron patch JSON updater path, old Electron release channel, or old Electron installer flow.

Because the Tauri updater public key/signature is not configured for the current B2 decision, this build is detection-only and will not download or install updates. Users must install a future signed build manually unless the release notes for that build explicitly state that signed updater installation is enabled.

## Release Notes Body

- Summarize user-visible fixes and parity work for this release.
- List known limitations that are still blocked by signing, release assets, provider credentials, or manual Windows validation.
- Do not describe this project as an official Netease Cloud Music, QQ Music, or original Mineradio distribution.
